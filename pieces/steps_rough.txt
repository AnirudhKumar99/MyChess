Game movement logic

    -Input two positions 
        eg src=a3, dest=b3
    -See piece at src
        -Check all positions possible for that piece
        -Updata possible boxes
        -Check if dest in possible boxes
            -possible 
                move piece from src to dest

To get src and dest for above logic
    -First mouseClick take box name(a1 to h8) as src
        -set a flag to true
        -calculate all possible boxes
    -Second mouseClick take box name as dest
        -check if dest in possible boxes
        if dest == src
            -no movement
            set flag to false
            do not change player
        else
            -movement
            set flag to false
            change player
